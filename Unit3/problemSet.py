"""Problem 1: Post Format Validator
You are managing a social media platform and need to ensure that posts are properly formatted. Each post must have balanced and correctly nested tags, 
such as () for mentions, [] for hashtags, and {} for links. You are given a string representing a post's content, 
and your task is to determine if the tags in the post are correctly formatted.

A post is considered valid if:

Every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag of the same type.
Tags are closed in the correct order.

def is_valid_post_format(posts):
  pass
Example Usage:

print(is_valid_post_format("()"))
print(is_valid_post_format("()[]{}")) 
print(is_valid_post_format("(]"))
Example Output:

True
True
False

              for result stack we want to make sure its empty becuase if it isn't the input isn't balanced.

Plan:
    - check length of input incase we return early.
    - we want to use a dict to store characters were looking for. {')':'('}
    - create a stack
    - iterate through input and store only opening brackets in the stack ['('] -> if we see a closing bracket (use dict) of same type ')' we can pop off stack
    - once we finish return if len(stack): return False else return True
    - return True if len(stack) == 0 else False

Problem 2: Reverse User Comments Queue
On your platform, comments on posts are displayed in the order they are received. However, for a special feature, you need to 
reverse the order of comments before displaying them. Given a queue of comments represented as a list of strings, reverse the order using a stack.

  pass
  
Example Usage:

print(reverse_comments_queue(["Great post!", "Love it!", "Thanks for sharing."]))

print(reverse_comments_queue(["First!", "Interesting read.", "Well written."]))

Example Output:

['Thanks for sharing.', 'Love it!', 'Great post!']
['Well written.', 'Interesting read.', 'First!']

Understand:

    Clarify - can input include empty strings? "", " "


Plan:
    - if len(comments) == 0: return comments
    - stack = []
    - result = []
    - iterate through the comments and append to our stack

Problem 3: Check Symmetry in Post Titles
As part of a new feature on your social media platform, you want to highlight post titles that are symmetrical,
meaning they read the same forwards and backwards when ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. Given a post title as a string,
use a new algorithmic technique the two-pointer method to determine if the title is symmetrical.

Problem 4: Engagement Boost
You track your daily engagement rates as a list of integers, sorted in non-decreasing order. 
To analyze the impact of certain strategies, you decide to square each engagement rate and then sort the results in non-decreasing order.

Given an integer array engagements sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Your Task:

Read through the existing solution and add comments so that everyone in your pod understands how it works.
Modify the solution below to use the two-pointer technique.


Example Usage:

print(engagement_boost([-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]))
print(engagement_boost([-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]))

Problem 5: Content Cleaner
You want to make sure your posts are clean and professional. Given a string post of lowercase and uppercase English letters, you want to remove any pairs of 
adjacent characters where one is the lowercase version of a letter and the other is the uppercase version of the same letter. 
Keep removing such pairs until the post is clean.

A clean post does not have two adjacent characters post[i] and post[i + 1] where:

post[i] is a lowercase letter and post[i + 1] is the same letter in uppercase or vice-versa.
Return the clean post.

Note that an empty string is also considered clean.
